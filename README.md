## Description
This is a program that helps run Automatic SQL queries based on the users input. You can select and view data from different tables, you add a new role, department, or employee, and you can also update the existing data of an employee in the table. Using inquirer you're prompted various questions until it can generate and run your SQL scripts 
## Installation
To install: Clone the repo and set up your own .env file. This will setup your credentials for you instead of hard-coding them in 
## Usage
To use, make sure you set up your .env file correctly and have access to the database that you are using. Optionally: you can run schema.sql and seed.sql using MYSQL to create a test database. You will also need to install the node dependecies using 'npm install'

From there, run node index.js for the prompts to begin. Follow the prompts and then it will log once successful. Use option 8 to quit
